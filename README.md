# Pred X

### Multi-modal Performance Prediction in Microservices Based Applications
PredX is a Neural Network model that utilizes a hybrid Graph Neural Network/Gated Recurrent Unit architecture to predict latency distribution of an API request. Not only do we predict end-to-end latency distribution but also the distribution of individual microservice calls involved in an API request.

### Datasets
This repository provides a way to reproduce the results on two benchmark datasets: Train Ticket and MicroSS.
Train Ticket: Train Ticket dataset is uploaded along with the code in this repository. 
MicroSS: Dataset can be downloaded from (https://github.com/CloudWise-OpenSource/GAIA-DataSet/tree/main/MicroSS). We only work with data in metric and trace folders.
